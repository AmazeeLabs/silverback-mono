- Typescript
- PostCSS with `postcss-preset-env`
- CSS Modules
- TailwindCSS + PurgeCSS
- Unit tests with mocha
- Integration tests with Cypress
- Mocking of GraphQL API's with Apollo

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **To create a new project:**
```sh
gatsby new my-project https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/gatsby-starter
cd my-project
direnv allow
yarn develop
```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-project` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
