# Amazee Gatsby Starter

The starter is developed in the [monorepo](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/tree/development/packages/npm/%40amazeelabs/gatsby-starter) and is published to a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/gatsby-starter).

The requirements are [the same as for the monorepo](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono#requirements), plus [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/#install-the-gatsby-cli).

To create a new project:
```sh
gatsby new my-project https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/gatsby-starter
cd my-project
direnv allow
yarn develop
```
