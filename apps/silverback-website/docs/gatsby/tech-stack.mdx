# Tech stack

Decide which package to use for a specific functionality is often hard. You need
to take into account a lot of different aspect, like:

- is it easy to use for other developers?
- is it reliable?
- is it actively maintained?
- is it well documented?

Here you'll find a list of battle-tested libraries that have already been used on our
projects. But remember, no package is universal, and you might end up using a
new one. Just ask yourself the questions above, and if the answer is yes, open a
pull request to add the new library to this documentation, so we can have a
discussion about integrating it in our stack.

You can use these websites to get different indicators, like popularity,
quality, stars or download count. Is then up to you to pick the right one for
your purpose.
