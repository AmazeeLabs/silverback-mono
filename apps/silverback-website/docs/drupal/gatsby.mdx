# Gatsby

An example how to connect Gatsby to Drupal via
[gatsby-graphql-toolkit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-graphql-toolkit).

## What's in the example

- **Drupal:** Manages the content (including content translations and URL
  aliases) and exposes it via a custom GraphQL schema.
- **Gatsby Preview:** A website used by editors to preview unpublished content.
- **Gatsby Site:** A production website serving pre-built static content.

Gatsby Preview and Gatsby Site are the same app. The first one is served with
`gatsby develop`, so it supports hot reload. The second one uses `gatsby build`
to produce static files.

Content fetched from Drupal:

- Page and Article content types.
- Taxonomy tags and media images used on the content.

## Features

- ðŸšš Drupal content updates trigger Gatsby Preview refresh and Gatsby Site
  rebuild.
- ðŸš€ Gatsby fetches only the content which was updated since the last build.
  This is true for both Gatsby Preview and Gatsby Site. You could call this Fast
  Builds.
- ðŸ”— Gatsby knows Drupal's content references. E.g. if a tag label is updated,
  Gatsby will refetch it and update all pages where it is used.

## How it works

Follow the links to get more technical details.

### Overview

- [apps/silverback-drupal](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/tree/development/apps/silverback-drupal#readme)
  - Provides a custom GraphQL schema via Drupal's GraphQL v4 module.
  - Uses Drupal's Gatsby module to ping Gatsby Preview refresh and Gatsby Site
    rebuild.
- [apps/silverback-gatsby](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/tree/development/apps/silverback-gatsby#readme)
  - Uses gatsby-graphql-toolkit to
    - transform Drupal's GraphQL schema into Gatsby's GraphQL schema
    - fetch content (and content changes) from Drupal

### Gatsby Preview

- Serves the site with `gatsby develop`.
- A POST request to `{gatsbyPreviewUrl}/__refresh` refreshes the content and
  updates the frontend.

### Gatsby Site

- Locally the site is served with `gatsby build && gatsby serve`.
- On Lagoon setup it is built in a Lagoon container and then is deployed to
  Netlify.
- Both implementations expose `{customAppUrl}/__rebuild` endpoint to re-build
  the site. The Gatsby data is preserved between the re-runs, so the re-builds
  are fast.

### How the example setup is tested

See details in
[apps/silverback-gatsby/test.sh](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/blob/development/apps/silverback-gatsby/test.sh).

## How to run Gatsby Site fast builds in production

Options:

- Gatsby Cloud. The example works just fine there.
- Lagoon + Netlify setup can be found in the example.
  - Netlify could be replaced with any other static file server, including
    Lagoon itself.
- Anything that can run Node.js.

## How to run the example locally

Set up the monorepo locally as described in the
[readme](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono#setup-locally).

Prepare (run from the silverback-mono root):

```shell
cd apps/silverback-drupal
direnv allow
composer install
silverback setup

cd ../..

cd apps/silverback-gatsby
direnv allow
yarn codegen
```

To run Drupal (from `apps/silverback-drupal`):

- Start the server: `drush serve`
- Login to drupal: `drush uli`

To run Gatsby (from `apps/silverback-gatsby`):

- Preview:
  - `yarn develop`
  - Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the site
  - Visit
    [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) to
    see the GraphQL schema
- Site:
  - `yarn fast-builds:serve:local`
  - Visit [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

It is not possible to run Gatsby Preview and Gatsby Site in parallel from the
same directory because they use the same `.cache`. But if you really want to
make them work together:

- Get a separate clone of silverback-mono.
- Prepare it.
- Run Gatsby Site (or Gatsby Preview) from there.

**Have fun!**
