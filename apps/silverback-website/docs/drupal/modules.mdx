# Contributed Drupal modules

This document is a comprehensive list of Drupal extensions that we support to be
used in projects. Other modules _must not_ be installed on a per-project basis.
If Drupal Core in combination with extensions on this list is not enough to meet
specific requirements, there are three possible paths:

1. Implement a custom, in-project module with fully automated test coverage.
2. Add a pull request to this document, adding the desired module.
3. Contribute to any module on this list to add the required features.

Adding arbitrary modules with varying quality to projects whenever a requirement
arises should be avoided. As well as patching modules and thereby creating
unstable dependencies.


## Confirmed modules

### GraphQL version 4

GraphQL is the default solution for exposing data and operations to the
frontend. Every project should have its own custom GraphQL schema that documents
the domain model and acts as a contract between Drupal and all consumers.
For in-depth on how to create custom GraphQL schemas, please refer to the
[module documentation](https://drupal-graphql.gitbook.io/graphql/).

### Focal Point

## Prohibited modules
Don't even bother to start a discussion.

### Paragraphs
Paragraphs generate immense load on the database and lead to lacking (up to non-
existent) content modeling. Compared to other page building solutions, the
editing experience is abysmal, it produces a high level of confusion and
complexity in multilingual setups and should be avoided at all cost.

### JSON:API
Drupal Core's API solution lacks typing and polymorphism features that GraphQL
brings to the table and therefore hurts developer experience and long term
maintainability. If there is the need to expose a public API endpoint, the
recommended way is to set up a dedicated service that consumes the GraphQL API
instead.
