# PHPStan for Drupal modules

[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) is a static analysis tool for PHP code.

Main features:

- It forces you to add type annotations for everything.
- It checks if correct types are passed around.
- It supports generics!
- It has a number of plugins extending its functionality.

## Adding PHPStan checks to a Drupal module

1. You'll need at least
   [mglaman/phpstan-drupal](https://github.com/mglaman/phpstan-drupal) and
   [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer)
   as dev dependencies for your module.

Unfortunately, you cannot just add them to `require-dev` of your module
`composer.json`. Because you will run tests for the module from within a Drupal
installation and `composer install` will only load `require-dev` dependencies
for the root project. Therefore, you need to keep your dev dependencies in a
separate `-dev` project and then require this project from your testing Drupal
installation.

As an example, see Cypress module
([PR #274](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/pull/274)): - all dev
dependencies are listed in `drupal/cypress-dev` metapackage -
`drupal/cypress-dev` is required from `silverback-drupal` (which is used to run
tests for `cypress`) - `drupal/cypress-dev` is required from `cypress` module
(just as a guide for developers looking for dev dependencies)

1. Create `phpstan.neon` file in the module root. Example:

```yaml
parameters:
  level: 8
  checkGenericClassInNonGenericObjectType: false
  checkMissingIterableValueType: false
  paths:
    - my_module.module
    - my_module.install
    - src
    - tests
```

See [PHPStan docs](https://phpstan.org/config-reference) for all available
options.

1. Run the checks from the Drupal root:

```
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --configuration=web/modules/custom/my_module/phpstan.neon
```

## Additional plugins

Some popular plugins for PHPStan:

- [phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules)
  reports usages of deprecated code (consider it only if you run PHPStan from
  the oldest supported version of Drupal)
- [phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules)
  provides very strict rules

See other plugins at https://phpstan.org/user-guide/extension-library

## IDE support

PhpStorm will have a
[built-in support for PHPStan soon](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2020/07/phpstan-and-psalm-support-coming-to-phpstorm/),
[maybe in PhpStorm 2020.3](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-35063). The
community
[plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12754-phpstan--psalm--generics) is
unfortunately
[broken](https://github.com/Haehnchen/idea-php-generics-plugin/issues/56) at the
moment.
