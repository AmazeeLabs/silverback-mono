# Monorepo

## Requirements and installation

The Silverback repository is set up as a monorepo managed with [Lerna]. To work
with it, make sure these four tools are available in your environment:

- [nodejs]
- [pnpm]
- a [php] interpreter [meeting Drupal's requirements][php_requirements]
- [composer]

[php]: https://www.php.net/
[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/
[composer]: https://getcomposer.org/
[php_requirements]:
  https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/php-requirements
[lerna]: https://lerna.js.org/

To start working with it simply clone it, install the dependencies and bootstrap
Lerna.

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono.git
cd silverback-mono
pnpm i && pnpm build
```

## Directory structure

- **`packages/npm`**: Contains shared node modules. The underlying folder
  structure has to match the npm namespace. For example
  `packages/npm/cypress-screenplay` or
  `packages/npm/@amazeelabs/prettier-config`.
- **`packages/composer`**: Any shared composer packages. Every package has to
  have a namespace that has to be reflected in the folder structure. For example
  `packages/composer/drupal/cypress`.
- **`apps`**: Applications that reference packages, but are not published
  anywhere.
  - **`apps/silverback-website`**: The Gatsby website hosting this
    documentation.
  - **`apps/silverback-drupal`**: A Drupal installation that is linked to
    `packages/composer` and `silverback-cli`. It's automatically updated, for
    constantly integration testing modules.

## Branching and commit conventions

Commits have to satisfy the [conventional commits] specification, so we are able
to produce automated release numbers and changelogs. The "scope" segment should
reflect the component that has been changed.

```
fix(drupal/cypress): fixed some bug

This was a very annoying bug!

or

feat(silverback-gatsby): add gatsby starter docs #97

Add favicon to meta component

```

If you are not sure, run the following, and answer to the best of your knowledge.

```
pnpm commit
```

[conventional commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

*Commits follow conventional commits*
- (feat = something new, fix = something was broken, refactor = changes without effect, perf = no effect but hopefully faster â€¦).
- use the package name as context (name in package.json).
- try not to do too broad cross-package changes. If necessary, omit the parantheses.
- use imperative, not past tense. "Add", "remove", "Update".

Changes have to be submitted as pull requests against the `development` branch,
which may be merged when tests pass, and the change has been reviewed by at
least one team member.

## Release process

When a pull request is merged, the automatic release process kicks in. It will
run tests for packages affected by the changes, determine the new release
versions and publish them to the respective ecosystem.

For [npm] it just follows the standard release process. For other targets, we
use an open source proxy registry called [Verdaccio] combined with our storage
plugin "[verdaccio-git]", which will commit and push the new release package to
a target git repository. The repository url and branch are defined in the
`publishConfig` property of `package.json`, along with a `registry` setting,
that will cause lerna's publish process to target the local verdaccio instance
that is started during the release process.

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://localhost:4873",
    "repository": "git@github.com/my/repo.git",
    "branch": "development"
  }
}
```

[verdaccio-git]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/verdaccio-git

## Lifecycle hooks

_All_ packages and applications have to contain a `package.json` file that may
contain three lifecycle hooks:

2. `prepublish` is executed before tests are run, or a package is sent to any
   registry, npm as well as git, drupal.org or packagist. After this lifecycle
   hook the package should be in an _executable_ state. It's a good point to
   transpile any sources or prepare binaries.
3. `test` is run for each package affected by the current changeset. The `test`
   script should make sure **all** possible checks are run. This also includes
   formatting, linting and typechecks.

## Adding new packages

### npm

Adding a new node module that is shared on npm is pretty straightforward. Just
create it within the `packages/npm` folder with `npm init`, or any other
scaffolder that outputs a npm package. Lerna will pick it up and attempt to
publish it to npm. The only problem you might face is when you create a
namespaced package, like the ones withing the `@amazeelabs` namespace.
Namespaced packages are treated as "private" by default, so to publish it
publicly, you have to set the `access` property of `publishConfig`.

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

### Git

Any npm package can also be published to a git remote instead of an actual npm
registry. A use case for this are gatsby starters, which are technically npm
packages, but are pulled from git repositories instead. To make this happen,
follow these steps:

1. Create the remote git repository
2. Make sure the git repository accepts the public SSH key used by Silverback
   automation (TODO: currently managed by philipp.melab@amazee.com, find a
   better place for it)
3. Make sure the host key is
   [accepted by the release process](https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/silverback-mono/blob/6902e436242b61c334431cc7572e913bd906fd0b/.github/workflows/release.yml#L50-L51)
4. Add the `publishConfig` configuration as outlined above and make sure the
   root `private` property is **not true**, or it won't be published at all.

```json
{
  "private": false,
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://localhost:4873",
    "repository": "git@github.com/my/repo.git",
    "branch": "development"
  }
}
```

To add a dependency to another npm package withing the monorepo, add it
_manually_ to `package.json` and run `lerna bootstrap` afterwards:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "cypress-screenplay": "^0.1.13"
  }
}
```

This will make sure the dependency is available and lerna is aware of it, so it
can determine which packages are affected by changes and automatically update
it.

### packagist

Packagist just reads git repositories, so just follow the steps on how to
publish to a git repository first. Create the `package.json` file even if there
are no npm dependencies. The deployment process uses it to also manage composer
dependencies.

Make sure to add a path repository to the packages `composer.json` file that
allows us to install local versions of composer dependencies. It will be removed
automatically during the publishing process.

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../../packages/composer/*/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The npm package name in `package.json` should be the composer package name,
prefixed with `@-`. For example `@-drupal/cypress`, so the composer package can
be referenced as a npm package within the monorepo.

When adding a composer dependency, make sure to add it to `composer.json` as a
development dependency, to match the copy in the path repository ...

```json
{
  "require": {
    "amazeelabs/silverback-cli": "@dev"
  }
}
```

... and also depend on it by it's "npm name" in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@-amazeelabs/silverback-cli": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

While publishing the package, the dependency version in `package.json` will
automatically updated by lerna, and the result version is written to
`composer.json`. This way, the lerna dependency graph and change detection is
available for composer packages too.

### drupal.org

Publishing to _drupal.org_ is identical to _packagist_. The release job will
create a new tag that is pushed to the git repository. Unfortunately a new
release won't be automatically available, like on packagist, which means we
still have to
["create" the release manually](https://www.drupal.org/node/1068944).

## Applications

Applications live in the first level of the `apps` directory and behave almost
identical to packages. There are only two differences:

1. Applications should have set `private` to `true` at the root level of their
   `package.json` to make sure they are not accidentally published to npm.
   Unless they are consciously released, to another git repository for example.
2. While lockfiles (composer.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml) make no sense for packages, they
   should be added and committed for applications.

Dependency management and lifecycles work exactly the same as for packages.
