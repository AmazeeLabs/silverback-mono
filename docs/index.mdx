# Silverback

## Web development without compromises

Amazee Labs has been around for a while. We've celebrated our successes and
learned from our mistakes. The Silverback project is our way to persist this
knowledge - for us and for the community that we owe so much.

We excel at building modern web applications, with a focus on Gatsby, React and
Drupal. This repository is an ever-growing collection of plugins, modules,
tools, recipes and tips that we picked up on our journey. All with the one goal
in mind: To make development and maintenance rewarding, productive and
sustainable.

### Core values

- **Maximise open source:** Altruism is great, but it doesn't pay the bills.
  Contribution is not something we do "when there is time", but within our daily
  work. For our own sake and our clients benefit.
- **Minimize tooling:** If one has to start a virtual machine, download the
  production database and run a SOLR indexing job to be able to change the
  headline color of a search result list, something is terribly wrong.
  Unfortunately we didn't make this up, but have seen it far too often. We apply
  strict separation of concerns to not slow down developers by chaining them to
  monoliths.
- **Automate everything:** Testing is boring, updating is boring, deploying is
  boring, coming up with release numbers is _really_ boring. Bored humans make
  mistakes. Machines don't make mistakes and they don't complain (yet). So we
  strife to free our brains from everything we can let machines do and put them
  onto more interesting tasks.
- **Truly agile:** Over-engineering and -planning are the biggest problems in
  software development. Our technology stack is carefully selected to start with
  quick and simple solutions that can be scaled up in complexity based on
  _evident business value_ instead of _premature guesswork_.

### Initiatives

The Silverback project is divided into four core initiatives that make up the
"limbs" our solutions stand on:

- **Decoupled frontend:** Starter kits, libraries and workflows we use to work
  with the Gatsby and React ecosystem and connect it to our data backends.
- **Editing experience:** Technology that enables users to interact with
  documents. Primarily the Sections editor.
- **Content management:** Systems to model how documents are managed. Ranging
  from simple (NetlifyCMS) to large scale distributed solutions (Drupal
  workspaces, Delivery).
- **[Tooling & Automation](/docs/tooling/index.mdx):** Everything that makes
  developers lives easier, like Linting, automated testing and release
  management.

### Implementation

On a technical level the _Silverback_ mono-repository serves as the central
point for developing, maintaining and documenting our open source solutions. I
helps us to easily apply changes and run integration tests across multiple
interconnected projects we contribute to and automatically publishes them to
their respective ecosystems, like npmjs, drupal.org or packagist.
