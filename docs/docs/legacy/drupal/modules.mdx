# Contributed Drupal modules

This document is a comprehensive list of Drupal extensions that we support to be
used in projects. Other modules _must not_ be installed on a per-project basis.
If Drupal Core in combination with extensions on this list is not enough to meet
specific requirements, there are three possible paths:

1. Implement a custom, in-project module with fully automated test coverage.
2. Add a pull request to this document, adding the desired module.
3. Contribute to any module on this list to add the required features.

Adding arbitrary modules with varying quality to projects whenever a requirement
arises should be avoided. As well as patching modules and thereby creating
unstable dependencies.


## Confirmed modules

### [GraphQL version 4](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql)

GraphQL is the default solution for exposing data and operations to the
frontend. Every project should have its own custom GraphQL schema that documents
the domain model and acts as a contract between Drupal and all consumers.
For an in-depth overview on how to create custom GraphQL schemas, please refer to the
[module documentation](https://drupal-graphql.gitbook.io/graphql/).

### [Admin Toolbar](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar)
An enhanced administration toolbar with dropdown menus and quick access to
frequently used features.

### [Token](https://www.drupal.org/project/token)
Token replacement in Drupal. Used by various other modules. Also allows to add
project specific tokens that can be reused across the application.

### [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto)
Automatically generate path aliases for content, based on patterns. Integrates
with token and redirect.

### [Redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect)
Manage HTTP redirects for paths in Drupal. Integrates with pathauto to
automatically add redirects when a pages path changes.

> *TODO:* There are multiple ways to use redirects in a decoupled setup. We
> need some canonical examples.

### [Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform)
Create and manage end user form and form submissions. Supports multiple
backends.

> *Note:* No integration for decoupling. Current approach is to embed the Drupal
> form page as an iframe.

### [Gatsby](https://www.drupal.org/project/gatsby)
Trigger Gatsby builds and preview refreshes for changing content.

### [Field group](https://www.drupal.org/project/field_group)
Organise complex entity forms with tabs, accordions etc.

### [Linkit](https://www.drupal.org/project/linkit)
Improved linking experience, that allows fine-grained control over possible link
targets. Can be extended with suggestion plugins that aid the editor in finding
targets and linking them correctly.

### [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api)
Populate and query search indices. The go-to solution for advanced search and
facets.

### [Field permissions](https://www.drupal.org/project/field_permissions)
Per-field permissions to protect certain fields being displayed to or edited by
certain roles. Mainly a user interface for Drupal Core's field permission API.

### [Address field](https://www.drupal.org/project/address)
Standardised solution for storing international addresses in Drupal.

### [Focal Point](https://www.drupal.org/project/focal_point)
Allow editors to set the focal point in uploaded images to make sure the area is
not affected by destructive cropping.

### [Cypress & Test session](https://www.drupal.org/project/cypress)
Write end2end Cypress tests and easily run integration tests against Drupal.

### [Taxonomy Entity Index](https://www.drupal.org/project/taxonomy_entity_index)
Run taxonomy-depth queries using index tables against all entities (Drupal core
only supports published nodes out of the box). Useful when using taxonomy
hierarchies for organising content in the backend (and potentially a lot of other
use cases).

### [Default Content](https://www.drupal.org/project/default_content)
Export Drupal content to files and import it on an install of a certain module.
Use cases: provide default content for Silverback installs, deploy content (e.g.
the default Commerce store).

## Prohibited modules
Don't even bother to start a discussion.

### Paragraphs
Paragraphs generate immense load on the database and lead to lacking (up to non-
existent) content modeling. Compared to other page building solutions, the
editing experience is abysmal, it produces a high level of confusion and
complexity in multilingual setups and should be avoided at all cost.

### JSON:API
Drupal Core's API solution lacks typing and polymorphism features that GraphQL
brings to the table and therefore hurts developer experience and long term
maintainability. If there is the need to expose a public API endpoint, the
recommended way is to set up a dedicated service that consumes the GraphQL API
instead.
