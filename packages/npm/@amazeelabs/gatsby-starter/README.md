fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the
    [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)
    to create a new site, specifying the Amazee starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the Amazee starter
    # TODO: expose starter
    gatsby new my-project STARTER_URL
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-project/
    yarn develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_.
    This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more
    about using this tool in the
    [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-project` directory in your code editor of choice and edit
    `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real
    time!
