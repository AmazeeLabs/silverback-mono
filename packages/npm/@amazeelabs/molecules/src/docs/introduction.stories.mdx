# Amazee Labs Molecules

A collection of reusable React components, built to be styled using
[TailwindCSS].

## Installation

```shell
npm install @amazeelabs/molecules
```

## Usage

Simply import and use components. They are optimized, tree-shakeable and ready
to be styled by adding `classNames`.

```tsx
import { Image } from '@amazeelabs/molecules';

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/my-image.jpg"
      alt="A beautiful image."
      classNames="border-solid border-red-500 border-3"
    />
  );
}
```

## Development

New molecules should be added to the `src/components` directory and referenced
in `src/index.ts`. Each new molecule should also have a set of stories, a
documentation page and possible unit tests. Please refer to
`src/components/Image.tsx`, `src/components/Image.stories.tsx`,
`src/components/Image.test.tsx` and `src/docs/components/Image.stories.mdx` for
a real world example.

## Visual styling

The development package contains [TailwindCSS], but only for the sake of example
styling in stories. Molecules should be largely agnostic to visual styling and
provide `className` properties style them where they are used. Styles that are
vital to the function of the molecule should be added with the `style` property.
