# Lagoon

The project is ready to be used with amazeeio local development flow. Just install [Pygmy], run `docker-compose up -d` and the site is ready to be installed.

## Drush aliases

Lagoon doesn't yet support just-in-time fetching of site aliases for drush 9. Please refer to [the docs](https://lagoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_lagoon/drupal/drush9/) for a work-around.
