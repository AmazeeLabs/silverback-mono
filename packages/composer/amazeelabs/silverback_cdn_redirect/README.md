# Silverback CDN Redirect

To be used with static websites, hosted on a CDN (e.g. Gatsby and Netlify).
Solves two problems:

1. Can resolve redirects that are not stored in CDN config, which is necessary,
   since Drupal's redirect module creates a redirect for each path change, which
   can be a lot. In that case, the redirect is resolved by rewriting the request
   to Drupal.
2. Rewrite paths not know by the CDN, to client-side rendered pages. Useful for
   pages that should not be rendered statically.

  subgraph Drupal
      RedirectCheck{Drupal redirect exists?}
      EntityCheck{Drupal page exists?}
      RequestNotFound[Fetch 404 from CDN]
      RequestCSR[Fetch CSR template from CDN]
  end

  subgraph CDN
      Request(User navigates to path)
      CDNCheck{Static page exists?}
      CDNDeliver{{Respond with static page}}
      CDNRedirect{{Respond with redirect from Drupal}}
      CDNRewrite{{Respond with content from Drupal}}
  end

  CDNCheck -- no --> RedirectCheck
  RedirectCheck -- yes --> CDNRedirect
  RedirectCheck -- no --> EntityCheck
  Request --> CDNCheck
  CDNCheck -- yes --> CDNDeliver
  EntityCheck -- no --> RequestNotFound
  EntityCheck -- yes --> RequestCSR
  RequestNotFound ----> CDNRewrite
  RequestCSR ----> CDNRewrite
```

## Drupal config

- Patch Drupal with a patch from
  [#2741939](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2741939)
- Enable the module
- Set the settings, for example:
  ```
  drush cset silverback_cdn_redirect.settings base_url https://my-gatsby.site
  drush cset silverback_cdn_redirect.settings 404_path /404
  drush cset silverback_cdn_redirect.settings should_prefix_404_path true
  ```

## Gatsby config

- Add
  [gatsby-plugin-netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-netlify)
  package
- Configure the catch-all redirect in `createPages`
  ```js
  createRedirect({
    fromPath: '/*',
    toPath: `https://my-drupal.site/cdn-redirect/:splat`,
    statusCode: 200,
  });
  ```
  Note: `statusCode: 200` is required to "hide" the request to backend from the
  browser.
